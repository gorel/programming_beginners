# Part 1 objectives:
In this first part of the project, we will create the core scaffolding to support a Boggle game.
Although I've written the skeleton code already, none of the core game logic has been implemented.
Your job will be to look at the code and figure out how to get it to run properly.

At the end of this week's work, you will have a playable game!

        4. "Magic methods"

4. Finally, implement the functions in boggle.py to make your game playable
