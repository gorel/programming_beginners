# Part 3 objectives:
In this objective, you will learn about the argparse library.
Argparse is useful for askng for a bunch of configuration options up-front before a program begins.
For a commandline program, this is similar to a "settings menu" in a video game.
We make the user give us a lot of information up front, but then the game never has to pause the fun later.

At the end of this week's work, our game will have a lot of clean-up done to use argparse.
This isn't the coolest feature-rich update, but it's important for a maintainable program.
